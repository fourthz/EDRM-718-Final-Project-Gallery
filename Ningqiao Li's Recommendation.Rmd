#### Ningqiao Li's recommendation
I recommend the 4th table in my notebook ,which is the correlation between average GPA and graduation optimism, the graph well shows the scatter plot, the correlation coeficient with p value, and the regression line with a range of 95% confidence interval. It is very comprehensive and clear. So I recommand it.
