I am using this notebook to gather your recommendations regarding the visual 
displays from your analysis that I should highlight when I present this 
project. Please make sure your figure is clearly labeled in your project
notebook so that you can refer to it in this notebook when you make your
recommendation. Also provide a short explanation of why you believe this
graph should be included in my final report to the client. Note that multiple 
analysts are welcome to suggest the same type of graph from their report. 
I will look at all suggestions and graphs before making a final decision.

Please keep this notebook neat and consistent.

#### Mike's Recommendation

I suggest using Figure #4 from my analysis. This graph clearly displays the
relationship of GPA and survey results separately for the disciplines. It 
will help the client understand how academic achievement might play a
different role in perceived optimism about future jobs for the different
disciplines.

#### Anna Ehrhorn's Recommendation

I suggest using the scatterplot under question #2 and boxplot for question #3. 
The scatterplot demonstrates the relationship of GPA and survey
results separately for each discipline. This will provide more information
on the relationship for each discipline. The boxplot will demonstrate the
lack of degree of optimism difference between the various disciplines.
