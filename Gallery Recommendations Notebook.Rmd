I am using this notebook to gather your recommendations regarding the visual 
displays from your analysis that I should highlight when I present this 
project. Please make sure your figure is clearly labeled in your project
notebook so that you can refer to it in this notebook when you make your
recommendation. Also provide a short explanation of why you believe this
graph should be included in my final report to the client. Note that multiple analysts are welcome to suggest the same type of graph from their report. 
I will look at all suggestions and graphs before making a final decision.

Please keep this notebook neat and consistent.

#### Ruiqin Gao's Recommendation
I suggest using Figure 4 from my notebook analysis. This graph clearly displays
optimism score differencesamong students in different discipline groups. 
It will help the client visually understand the optimism score differences 
across discipline groups and whether the differences are big or small between
different discipline groups.
